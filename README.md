# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game! This project provides a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply follow these steps:

1. Open the [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://patelalay231.github.io/Tic-Tac-toe/) in your web browser.
2. Choose a player to start the game. Player 1 typically goes first, and the game alternates between players after each turn.
3. Click on an empty cell in the game grid to place your mark (either 'X' or 'O').
4. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
5. If all cells are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
